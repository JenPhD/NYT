//it like you are going to create a bootstrap site and create a linked javascript 
//file (after the linked jQuery that works with Bootstrap 2.2.4?).  
//Test the javascript file with a console.log ("Made it"); sanity check.  
//You may want to keep this 'blank template' around and it will definitely help 
//out in class tomorrow.  The class pace will feel much more comfortable if you can 
//get at least some time spent on this beforehand.
